# Gauss-Jacobi

The Gaussâ€“Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.
Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in.
The process is then iterated until it converges.

Currently it works for 3 variables only and iterates 10 times.

Modifications are being made to make it work for n variables.
